# Linear regression codes
"""
In this code, we will see a short linear regression code, we need to import some libraries first.
Note: this code is implemented in python.
"""
#// The libraries that we need for this practice are: Numpy, pandas and matplotlib.
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

#// 
"""
First step: we need to load the dataset that we will use for all the code, 
for linear regression, we only have two parameters, X and Y.
"""
dataset = pd.read_csv('Data1.csv')

dataset = pd.read_csv('Data1.csv')
